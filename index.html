          'Les Choses de la Vie' is a movie about fate and left chances in live. 
          A Paris architect in his forties driving to a meeting at Rennes, Pierre had quarreled with his lover Hélène (Romy Schneider) the previous night. They were due to leave together for a job he was offered in Tunis but he hadn't signed the documents. But he had agreed to take his teenage son Bertrand, who lived with his estranged wife Catherine, for a holiday in the family's holiday home on the Île de Ré. Stopping at a café, he wrote to Hélène calling everything off, but did not post the letter. Driving past a wedding, he decides that the letter was quite wrong and he should marry Hélène.
          Rushed to hospital in Le Mans, he does not recover. As his widow, Catherine is given his effects, including the unsent letter to Hélène. Catherine is reading it when she sees Hélène arriving. She tears it to pieces, and Hélène is told by a nurse that she is too late.The structure of the film involves frequent jumps in time - between the time of, and after, the car crash, and before the crash. The opening sequence jumps between the period immediately after the crash, and the crash itself.
          Driven by to outstanding actors, the movie is touching emotionally and intelectually. It drives the mind to the final questions in life. 
          It is for me the best movie ever made.

        'Dr. Schiwago'The film is mostly set against a backdrop of World War I, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Russian Civil War. A narrative framing device, set in the late 1940s or early 1950s, involves KGB Lieutenant General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago searching for the daughter of his half-brother, Doctor Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago, and Larissa ("Lara") Antipova. Yevgraf believes a young woman, Tanya Komarova, may be his niece, and tells her the story of her father's life.
        After his mother's burial in rural Russia, the orphaned child Yuri Zhivago is taken in by family friends in Moscow: Alexander and Anna Gromeko. In 1913, Zhivago, now a doctor but a poet at heart, is reunited with the Gromeko's daughter, Tonya, when she returns to Moscow after her schooling in Paris. They soon become engaged. Meanwhile, Lara, only 17 years, becomes secretly involved with her mother's friend/lover, the older well-connected Victor Ippolitovich Komarovsky. One night, Lara's friend, the idealistic reformer Pavel Pavlovich "Pasha" Antipov, is wounded by sabre-wielding Cossacks during a violent attack on a peaceful civil demonstration. Pasha goes to Lara, whom he wishes to marry, and she treats his wound. He asks her to hide a gun he picked up at the attack.
