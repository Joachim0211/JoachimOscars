          'Les Choses de la Vie' is a movie about fate and left chances in live. 
          A Paris architect in his forties driving to a meeting at Rennes, Pierre had quarreled with his lover Hélène (Romy Schneider) the previous night. They were due to leave together for a job he was offered in Tunis but he hadn't signed the documents. But he had agreed to take his teenage son Bertrand, who lived with his estranged wife Catherine, for a holiday in the family's holiday home on the Île de Ré. Stopping at a café, he wrote to Hélène calling everything off, but did not post the letter. Driving past a wedding, he decides that the letter was quite wrong and he should marry Hélène.
          Rushed to hospital in Le Mans, he does not recover. As his widow, Catherine is given his effects, including the unsent letter to Hélène. Catherine is reading it when she sees Hélène arriving. She tears it to pieces, and Hélène is told by a nurse that she is too late.The structure of the film involves frequent jumps in time - between the time of, and after, the car crash, and before the crash. The opening sequence jumps between the period immediately after the crash, and the crash itself.
          Driven by to outstanding actors, the movie is touching emotionally and intelectually. It drives the mind to the final questions in life. 
          It is for me the best movie ever made.

        'Dr. Schiwago' is a movie about dramatic changes in life due to dramatic circumstances and at the same time the vital importance of consistend values, principles and enduring love.
        The film is mostly set against a backdrop of World War I, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Russian Civil War. A narrative framing device, set in the late 1940s or early 1950s, involves KGB Lieutenant General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago searching for the daughter of his half-brother, Doctor Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago, and Larissa ("Lara") Antipova. Yevgraf believes a young woman, Tanya Komarova, may be his niece, and tells her the story of her father's life.
        After his mother's burial in rural Russia, the orphaned child Yuri Zhivago is taken in by family friends in Moscow: Alexander and Anna Gromeko. In 1913, Zhivago, now a doctor but a poet at heart, is reunited with the Gromeko's daughter, Tonya, when she returns to Moscow after her schooling in Paris. They soon become engaged. Meanwhile, Lara, only 17 years, becomes secretly involved with her mother's friend/lover, the older well-connected Victor Ippolitovich Komarovsky. One night, Lara's friend, the idealistic reformer Pavel Pavlovich "Pasha" Antipov, is wounded by sabre-wielding Cossacks during a violent attack on a peaceful civil demonstration. Pasha goes to Lara, whom he wishes to marry, and she treats his wound. He asks her to hide a gun he picked up at the attack.
        Doctor Zhivago is a 1965 epic romantic drama movie. The movie is about life in Russia before and during World War I and during the Russian Civil War from 1917-1922. The movie is based on a novel of the same name. It was written by Boris Pasternak. The movie was banned in the Soviet Union. It could not be made there and also could not be shown in theatres after it was released. It was first shown in Russia in 1994. The movie was directed by David Lean.
        Critics complained when the movie was released because its running time was over three hours. Also, critics thought that the history in the movie was not told correctly. Over time, opinions changed. Now it is thought by the public to be one of David Lean's best movies.[2] It was ranked by the American Film Institute in 1998 as the 39th greatest American movie of all time.
        The movie won five Academy Awards. It was entered into the 1966 Cannes Film Festival.
        It is - in my opinion - the secondbest movie of all time.

        <p> Out of Africa is a movie that highlights the fragile and ephemeres character of 'happiness windows' in life. It depicts at the same time the lasting power and beauty of nature.
            Karen Blixen recalls her past life in Africa where she moved in 1913 as an unmarried wealthy Danish woman. After having been being spurned by her Swedish nobleman lover, she asks his brother Baron Bror Blixen to get married out of mutual convenience, and they move to the vicinity of Nairobi, British East Africa.
            Using her funds, he is to set up a cattle ranch, with her joining him a few months later, at which time they will marry. En route to Nairobi, her train is hailed by a big-game hunter by the name of Denys Finch Hatton who knows her fiancé and entrusts his haul of ivory to her.
            Over time, on the ranch a relationship between the two developed in which the nature on the farm in Africa plays a central role often seen on flight trips on Denny's plane. Karen is seriously ill and can only be treated in Denmark, while Denys has reservations to leave Africa. 
            Denys visits the now-empty house and Karen comments that the house should have been so all along and, as with her other efforts, the returning of things to their natural state is as it should be. Denys says that he was just getting used to her things.
            As he is about to depart for a safari scouting trip in his airplane, they agree that the following Friday he will return and fly her to Mombasa; with Karen then continuing on to Denmark and he to follow. Friday comes and Denys does not appear. Bror then arrives to tell her that Denys' biplane has crashed and burned in Tsavo.
            He stays in Africa and is burried on the farm at a place where a lions usally comes to in the evening.
            It is - in my opinion - the thirdbest movie of all time.
